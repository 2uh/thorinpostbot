NiP are insanely popular and Sweden has less than double the population.
Congrat that with teams like mouz that the public raves over but no analyst I know thinks is elite or gonna be elite any time soon.
It's not a coincidence that all the analysts I know seem to rate both those teams higher than the general public.
I think it's more that they play tactically, which causes their players to be more restricted and thus go less ham individually and thus get under-rated.  Add in that many casual fans don't understand tactics.

Based in my own experiences, when people talk about "politics" or "networking" as if they are inherently bad things they are speaking from a position of weakness and simply refusing to level up and actually compete.
Believe whatever you want.  Sounds as if you imagine yourself superior on the basis you read a news story about a report you've never read.  If that's your bag then enjoy.
You're welcome to argue someone else is better or more deserving, but nobody on that list of nominees did more journalism than me over that time-frame.
What's more my Thoughts videos essentially operate as op-eds from someone who would be a veteran editor-in-chief in the hierarchy of a modern news organisation.  You may now be aware these things are journalism, but that's your own oversight.
I don't ascribe you any malice, since your tone seems sincere, but this is just ignorance.  I did dozens of interviews over the time-span in question, hosted panel talk shows and undertook a few investigative assignments.

You must have a pretty low opinion of SK's team-play and tactics if you think they had 3 of the 10 best players in the world. I respect them and what they were able to accomplish more than that.

LOL, does sound harsh.  You're a solid pro but EliGE is special. I respect you've been able to carve out a pro career, especially since you can't do it playing on a team from your country.

Het maakt niet uit hoe langzaam je gaat, zolang je maar niet stopt.

Funny thing is, I actually would have put EliGE around 11-13.  Difference is, I wouldn't ever put NiKo 2016 outside of the top 10 and he should be a very strong candidate for top 3.
Still waiting for him to ever include any analysis in his pieces, beyond telling us which number is higher :>

I also think it is an overwhelming positive for the community that a site like theirs publishes such rankings, whether I agree with a placing or not.  I'd much rather live in a world with these rankings than have none at all from their site.
My commentary on the yearly rankings has no relation to my disputes with HLTV over how they run their site.

The point of top X lists and power rankings is to provoke discussion.
inb4 ppl tell me I am biased against EliGE even though I think he's the chosen one of NA and set to become one of the all-time great world-wide players one day.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hK0w6-MiRM …
You destroy your credibility and any consistency in your criteria when you tell people EliGE was better than k0nfig in 2017.  Basically, k0nfig punished himself by going further in tournaments and playing more aggro, since it made his numbers worse.
NiKo in 2016 = 11th
EliGE in 2017 = 12th

Child, pls.

One was operating at a god-like level likes of which we have rarely ever seen and with an outrageously bad cast

Yes.  Meat especially gets way lower if you buy a lot and have a freezer.

Thorin's Platform: Sam W. Delorme on Helping North Break Through (CS:GO) 
@samwdelormehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ajnNRrT3LQ …
No surprise HLTV shitters assumed it was all about them.  Their arrogance is a large part of why their site could get the most hits in the entire world and they'd still barely be able to monetise it would throwing their ethics out of the window.
None of these people are able to explain the style a team plays, qualitatively judge how well a player performs in their role, predict which matches they will win and how etc.

You know: the stuff we actually care about, not if 7 is a higher number than 6.
If someone is an expert at CS:GO, has a big database and has the ability to model the game, they should be able to produce some quality content which uses those numbers to say something any of us care about.
What's funny is I wasn't even solely to HLTV. They barely do stats analysis. There are much better statisticians and maths experts working on far superior models.

Point is that none of those people produce anything meaningful beyond some numbers.
I have a dxracer and it's pretty nice.
When even people criticising and insulting you causes them to have to talk about you for 100s of comments that's when you know you've completed the game.pic.twitter.com/ijHh2r7O6T
Analysing stats with zero bias would be saying "XANTARES is a top 10 player in the world because he has top 10 stats".

Any attempt you give at context is bias.  Deny it all you want, but you just show you don't understand analysis, bias or context.

You must have a pretty low opinion of SK's team-play and tactics if you think they had 3 of the 10 best players in the world. I respect them and what they were able to accomplish more than that.

Funny how when the fan favourites started to fail to even make it out of group stages at majors it became acceptable you could be considered good and yet not succeed at majors.

I agree with you that casters have power to begin changing the situation, though.
Great aid would be big TOs being willing to negotiate months ahead of time, so people could plan their calender. As long as they can't a lot of even top tier talent is worried about when their next gig will be.

Most events still negotiate only 2-5 weeks out.

I'm just wondering: maybe otters aren't interested in OWL and that's cool and they can just be interested in whatever otters are interested in?  Maybe I just respect the choices of otters too much?
"Why are there no otters in OWL?" is the wrong question.

Most of the mammals in OWL had been playing video games competitively for years before OW even came out.

The better question is "What can we do today so that there are otters in OWL five years from now?"

I also think it is an overwhelming positive for the community that a site like theirs publishes such rankings, whether I agree with a placing or not.  I'd much rather live in a world with these rankings than have none at all from their site.
My commentary on the yearly rankings has no relation to my disputes with HLTV over how they run their site.

The point of top X lists and power rankings is to provoke discussion.

You destroy your credibility and any consistency in your criteria when you tell people EliGE was better than k0nfig in 2017.  Basically, k0nfig punished himself by going further in tournaments and playing more aggro, since it made his numbers worse.
NiKo in 2016 = 11th
EliGE in 2017 = 12th

Thorin's Platform: Sam W. Delorme on Helping North Break Through (CS:GO) 
@samwdelormehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ajnNRrT3LQ …
No surprise HLTV shitters assumed it was all about them.  Their arrogance is a large part of why their site could get the most hits in the entire world and they'd still barely be able to monetise it would throwing their ethics out of the window.
None of these people are able to explain the style a team plays, qualitatively judge how well a player performs in their role, predict which matches they will win and how etc.

You know: the stuff we actually care about, not if 7 is a higher number than 6.
If someone is an expert at CS:GO, has a big database and has the ability to model the game, they should be able to produce some quality content which uses those numbers to say something any of us care about.
What's funny is I wasn't even solely to HLTV. They barely do stats analysis. There are much better statisticians and maths experts working on far superior models.

Point is that none of those people produce anything meaningful beyond some numbers.
I have a dxracer and it's pretty nice.

Two of the top 10 is pretty clear and Klay Thompson very likely would be both top 10 and an MVP candidate on a team where he had maximum resources, but 20 ppg, 4rb and 2.6ast is not top 10 in the modern NBA.

Obviously people are going to say the other teams only prac at that time, but it makes sense for all the top contenders to adjust their time and thus convince the others to.
Also under-rated to practice and play at the kind of hours you will play local time at the major you are about to attend.  Practicing 6pm-11pm CET doesn't make much sense if the major is in Sweden and your Swiss games are at 10am, f.e.
They also have PTSD from practising more than anyone in history with the first Titan line-up only to go out in the group stage and repeatedly get banged by the randomiser.  Superstition runs deep.

Need to in the context of it being the most likely path to getting more to a pro level?  Sure, but I also think a lot of those women who might have been good are probably off doing something else fun, which is cool too.
I have never been on the train of thinking that suggests the experiences of women in esports are identical to those of men and that there is no harassment or ill will towards them.  It's telling of the mentality of some that they can only paint me as such.
Agreed. I think it's only logical the transition into the community will be harder for those who are not part of the central in-group, in both directions. That's a great conversation to have as opposed to people taking such extreme positions in either direction.
Insecurity over being allowed to express their opinions is a powerful factor which keeps the majority silent, just the way this meddlesome minority want them.

Consider how unreasonable it is for someone with no understanding of a job market to make narrow-minded demands over who should be hired but without knowing the demographics of the market or any of the individuals in question and their competency.
The cycle will never end and as you give more and more ground, they will take up more and more ground and their demands will never cease.
Once that first pro is hired they'll shift from "why aren't there women?" to "why is there only 1 woman?". That's why hiring someone who isn't good enough, to placate them, is dangerous. They'll argue that this person being competent proves there must be others.
Say a female pro is picked up.  Now if she underperforms anyone criticising her will be labelled as a mysoginist and her performance will be blamed on the men around her and their attitudes.
Don't imagine giving in to the SJWs will stop their attacks, it will only see the target of their relentless and practically always ill-informed attacks change subtley.

How do you know?
Despite its overuse, the term racist is still one of the most dangerous loaded weapons out there, so be careful when you use it.

Asking for clarification of someone's statement is a good safety lock to apply before firing.  I've learned that myself recently.
I retract my comment suggesting it sounded racist.  Your clarification made a lot of sense and polished off any rough-seeming edges.
In this case you don't, but your more general point is entirely valid and one I'd agree with. 

Misunderstanding arises from using "white men" as the group mentioned in the original tweet.  Same point applies to basically any group who benefit from a status quo.
You used a specific example right now to make an abstract point.  I don't think it's unreasonable to then question if you have a specific point or case to bring to the table on this matter.
Do you know some women who are trying to play at a pro level, perhaps by entering the semi-pro scene now, and who are being denied the opportunity based on discrimination?  Can you share some leads with me in that respect?
This is a topic I have lined up to explore at the grass roots level, since it's difficult to draw sweeping judgements or conclusions on, but doing so means gathering as many experiences as possible.

Any time you write a "top" or "best" list people waste so much time and effort simply discussing players who are "good" or that they like rather than those who actually are the best or could be the best.

There's no "honourable mention" for G.O.A.T.
1. Goals
2. Schedule
3. Discipline

The third is a lot harder without the first two in place.
It's time to mix up some of these CIS rosters.  F3 has the veterans and Vega has the new school.  Being as Na`Vi and Gambit look off-limits, time to make a balanced squad.

The point tho is that players will complain about lack of prep time, yet this major is less than one month after ECS S4 finals.

Most esports beefs could be solved in 5 minutes with a kind word and a handshake.

Technically wasn't 1.6 back then, would have been 1.1 or 1.3, but the game is simply referred to as 1.6 nowadays.
This was in the very early days of POV demos and it was a "bad" habit he had, since he was so hyper as a player.  His demos popped off the hardest back then, since he had insane spray, and he had by far the most fans.
When you find out about weapon switch/reload bug in 1.6 which increased the next bullet accuracy with rifles it makes you wonder if HeatoN saved the game by non-stop spamming weapon switch while holding spots in 2001 and thus influencing a generation.
It's beyond tiresome to read fanboys acting like if the player they like said something in a scenario which is just "he said, she said" that it must be true and not simply that guy's perspective.

I have always asked the tough questions, as I see them, but I also always strive to ask them in an environment where the person can fully explain themselves, to reduce any potential harm from the nature of the topic.https://twitter.com/SirNitrocide/status/951454235790577666 …
I bring the traffic to my publication, not the other way around.  This is not the 20th century any more.  Those who are not interested in creating a personal brand should expect to never find the same level of success as those who are.
Poor excuse
Need to in the context of it being the most likely path to getting more to a pro level?  Sure, but I also think a lot of those women who might have been good are probably off doing something else fun, which is cool too.
I have never been on the train of thinking that suggests the experiences of women in esports are identical to those of men and that there is no harassment or ill will towards them.  It's telling of the mentality of some that they can only paint me as such.
Agreed. I think it's only logical the transition into the community will be harder for those who are not part of the central in-group, in both directions. That's a great conversation to have as opposed to people taking such extreme positions in either direction.
Insecurity over being allowed to express their opinions is a powerful factor which keeps the majority silent, just the way this meddlesome minority want them.

I, on the other hand, encourage everyone to speak their truth as they see it and let's see where we are.https://twitter.com/Am1racle/status/951546590417764352 …
There is a lack of that kind of content surrounding the EU LCS.
If you are arguing that disliking something someone said or wrote means everything else they have said or wrote should be written off then kindly apply the same logic to me and never contact me or consume my content again.
It's hard to recommend any category of people pursue becoming the best in the world at a competitive discipline. Channeling that drive to not ruin your life is incredibly complicated and an ever-changing challenge.

Most ppl play games to have fun.

I'd certainly tune in to watch :>
Consider how unreasonable it is for someone with no understanding of a job market to make narrow-minded demands over who should be hired but without knowing the demographics of the market or any of the individuals in question and their competency.
The cycle will never end and as you give more and more ground, they will take up more and more ground and their demands will never cease.
Once that first pro is hired they'll shift from "why aren't there women?" to "why is there only 1 woman?". That's why hiring someone who isn't good enough, to placate them, is dangerous. They'll argue that this person being competent proves there must be others.
Say a female pro is picked up.  Now if she underperforms anyone criticising her will be labelled as a mysoginist and her performance will be blamed on the men around her and their attitudes.
Don't imagine giving in to the SJWs will stop their attacks, it will only see the target of their relentless and practically always ill-informed attacks change subtley.
You believe in GamerGate.  Enough said.

Happy birthday to my boy @OnFireMoses. Easily the best hybrid talent (caster and analyst) in Counter-Strike and has one of my favourite laughs in the world. Have a sick major, mate.
He will begin tweeting about him AWPing any minute nnnnnnnnnnnow
How do you know?
Despite its overuse, the term racist is still one of the most dangerous loaded weapons out there, so be careful when you use it.

Asking for clarification of someone's statement is a good safety lock to apply before firing.  I've learned that myself recently.
I retract my comment suggesting it sounded racist.  Your clarification made a lot of sense and polished off any rough-seeming edges.
In this case you don't, but your more general point is entirely valid and one I'd agree with. 

Misunderstanding arises from using "white men" as the group mentioned in the original tweet.  Same point applies to basically any group who benefit from a status quo.
You used a specific example right now to make an abstract point.  I don't think it's unreasonable to then question if you have a specific point or case to bring to the table on this matter.
Do you know some women who are trying to play at a pro level, perhaps by entering the semi-pro scene now, and who are being denied the opportunity based on discrimination?  Can you share some leads with me in that respect?
This is a topic I have lined up to explore at the grass roots level, since it's difficult to draw sweeping judgements or conclusions on, but doing so means gathering as many experiences as possible.
It's a shame fox didn't join SK permanently.  Let's see them try to win majors on nightmare mode :>

Majors remind us how far CS:GO has come. What an amazing transformation from where it began.
The point tho is that players will complain about lack of prep time, yet this major is less than one month after ECS S4 finals.

How much time do these players want? Too many complaints without proposed solutions.
Most esports beefs could be solved in 5 minutes with a kind word and a handshake.

Don't mistake them for the actions of people trying to tear this community apart and sow dissent.

I suspect his point might include the factor that you are gambling the success of your org either way, so you may as well go with the game you feel most passionately about.  There is no guaranteed success with either title, no matter the strategy.

There are a lot of great discussions and opinions from women, like you outlined, that are sadly silenced by the militant and abusive stance of certain culture warriors.

Fair enough.  I think it's a positive sign that we can move past our preconceptions and have a discussion.
If you want to see a real discussion about the plight of women in esports which takes place in good faith and is productive in its nature:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_p--Umux_c …
Not sure what you mean by "even after".  I thought that show was a useful discussion on the topic that hopefully illuminated others to how different the experiences of women can be.
Absolutely.  I met her the better part of a decade ago now and she has been grinding and diligently working to improve just like I have.https://twitter.com/GazQwerty/status/951534136203804672 …
Would it be nice if more people got involved in esports professionally?  If they're good then we'll take everyone and hopefully be especially welcoming to those who seem different.

Let's be real, tho: ppl sparking these "outrages" aren't arguing in good faith.
In light of the discussion of the last few days, let's once more acknowledge a central fact:

The top professionals in esports who happen to be women got there through hard work and on merit, not due to tokenism of any kind.

The system works.
Most talented and successful women I've encountered in esports didn't want to be used as pawns in a perverse political game by ideologues who demand they remain silent or affirm someone  else's opinions.https://twitter.com/RedBluegg/status/951522349765087234 …
Part of not playing defense is that you don't waste your time and energy justifying things you never did or said.  Rather mould your clarifications until they become weapons to show what an asshole the other person is.

The onlookers can decide who wins.
I was quite explicilty clear, both in my tweets and more extensive work on the subject, that along with having too few women who pursue the obsession of competitive greatness there are, of that tiny niche, thusfar too few who are legitimately good.

I don't know why people always target pasha as a candidate to retire on the basis he has a kid.  Plenty of top athletes have children and can still perform and if you look at him in 2017 he was easily one of VP's best players.
Must not have watched all those maps where Astralis and G2 beat them
It's amazing that they kept the run going for so long, but change at least one player and create a new legacy that is special.  What's ridiculous is that they already did that in the past to establish this http://Virtus.pro  and to get pasha before that.
Nobody is required to condemn or condone anything.  We have not established Stalin-esque show trials and thought crime purges in esports yet, as much as that must irritate some.
Those arguing such a topic are no longer attempting to deal with discrimination, but rather hector others to apply an agenda of thought policing so there are only 2 sides.
The notion that suggesting we should also have compassion for a young man who has made the mistake of saying something considered discriminatory, being as he's a human too, is condoning his behaviour is not just false but utterly stupid.
I think FaZe themselves see it differently from you, since they force train so much.  Presumably PTSD from their NiP defeat.  I agree, I would go to cache a lot more, where they don't even necessarily need to change anything.
Did I stutter?
C9 are one of the only top teams aside from FaZe with a very limited map pool, which hurts them in bo1 scenarios.
Sad to see Cloud9 go 0:2. This should have been a major they were assured a Legends finish at. Then again, getting G2 was a bullshit draw, so it's not over yet.
Anyone who thinks WESG is even vaguely close to as important as a major has lost the plot. People think majors are just about the prize money missed the point entirely.
This has gone too far.
Whoever transcribed this fucked up the "Erik "zende" Sundeqvist" part. That should be Sunde, zonic's team-mate from mTw.

Don't be naive enough to imagine these articles are simply written by the incompetent. There are dozens of well known people would give them more accurate info and analysis but it doesn't fit their agenda so they don't seek it.
Polygon and Kotaku are clearly committed to trying make a buck on insulting and slandering the esports community with their identity politics lies.

Vote with your clicks, if you disagree with such behaviour, and don't incentivise such behaviour.
Calling a woman a bitch simply for being a woman is mysoginistic. The distinction is both clear and key.
There's nothing mysoginistic about calling a woman who has behaved despicably a bitch. It's entirely appropriate. Claiming women can never be insulted is pathetic infantilisation of an entire sex.

Also what is golden about this current five?  Their one major ever?  The whole point of the name is that the other five won a ton of majors.  As usual, never argue with morons.
It's a shame we can't have thumbnails on r/lol on the basis some fucks don't wanna watch the game live but also want to be able to browse without knowing the result.
I don't get sad watching this VP go out like this. It needed to happen so they could rethink the team and move on. All great line-ups come to an end, it just took this one over 4 years to figure that out. Time for a new VP.
Same with Phil Jackson. He legit never reacted to any insane buzzer beater.
This Pats game is heating up.
I don't block many people, don't think I have even 10, but I don't need to hear from those who unapologetically profit from racism as well as unethical gambling sponsorships.
If your first response to someone pointing out a very serious problem your community has with incubating and propagating racism is "well what about you?!?" you don't sound sincere about addressing the problem.
The owner literally tried to blame me for the racism in his community. That's how little they care and take responsibility for their own site.pic.twitter.com/bOuuHpCeQv
Never seen a gaming website so poor at moderating blatant racism on its forums as HLTV. No wonder sponsors run a mile.

The owner even recently threatened to IP ban me from the site yet seems to have no interest in doing the same to people posting slurs.
Crazy to think how much NiKo has accomplished already in such a young career but this is his first ever play-off appearance at a major.  Let's hope it's a good one!
Astralis literally used stand-ins and beat some of the very best teams in the world recently.  I think it's unreasonable to suggest they can't win any more games and are perma-bad now.
I mean FaZe looked rocky last week.
Hopefully SK draws QBF now and gets a free walk to the play-offs.  A bracket with FaZe, G2, SK and perhaps Astralis would be ideal.
What's hilarious is SK's stand-in excuse is significantly weaker than any other team's, since SK not only played for like 8 months of the last 12 with that player but even won big titles with him.

Crycoin still free as fuck right now tho.  Be sure to buy up! :>
Funny how the stand-in excuse only down-plays the wins of some teams and not others *cough*Blast*cough*

#FanLogic
The favourites for the tournament (FaZe) are through to the play-offs and it's gonna take a monster series from anyone to deny them the title.
Big psychological win for FaZe, especially since it was a come-back and they did it all on the T side.  Will stand them in very strong stead if they meet again.
Funny thing about this game is I'm pretty sure FaZe wanted SK to pick train and cache has always been a problem child for SK, even though they have won on it a lot.

Don't be naive enough to imagine these articles are simply written by the incompetent. There are dozens of well known people would give them more accurate info and analysis but it doesn't fit their agenda so they don't seek it.
Polygon and Kotaku are clearly committed to trying make a buck on insulting and slandering the esports community with their identity politics lies.

Vote with your clicks, if you disagree with such behaviour, and don't incentivise such behaviour.
Calling a woman a bitch simply for being a woman is mysoginistic. The distinction is both clear and key.
There's nothing mysoginistic about calling a woman who has behaved despicably a bitch. It's entirely appropriate. Claiming women can never be insulted is pathetic infantilisation of an entire sex.

I don't know why people always target pasha as a candidate to retire on the basis he has a kid.  Plenty of top athletes have children and can still perform and if you look at him in 2017 he was easily one of VP's best players.
Must not have watched all those maps where Astralis and G2 beat them
It's amazing that they kept the run going for so long, but change at least one player and create a new legacy that is special.  What's ridiculous is that they already did that in the past to establish this http://Virtus.pro  and to get pasha before that.
Nobody is required to condemn or condone anything.  We have not established Stalin-esque show trials and thought crime purges in esports yet, as much as that must irritate some.
Those arguing such a topic are no longer attempting to deal with discrimination, but rather hector others to apply an agenda of thought policing so there are only 2 sides.
The notion that suggesting we should also have compassion for a young man who has made the mistake of saying something considered discriminatory, being as he's a human too, is condoning his behaviour is not just false but utterly stupid.
I think FaZe themselves see it differently from you, since they force train so much.  Presumably PTSD from their NiP defeat.  I agree, I would go to cache a lot more, where they don't even necessarily need to change anything.
Did I stutter?
C9 are one of the only top teams aside from FaZe with a very limited map pool, which hurts them in bo1 scenarios.
Sad to see Cloud9 go 0:2. This should have been a major they were assured a Legends finish at. Then again, getting G2 was a bullshit draw, so it's not over yet.
Anyone who thinks WESG is even vaguely close to as important as a major has lost the plot. People think majors are just about the prize money missed the point entirely.
This has gone too far.

Almost like a ton of the tyler1 viewers were plebs just jumping on the hot thing, not actual fans of him who wanted to watch him play.
I think OWL should legitimately explore Quake-style brightskins and picmip approach to simplify the graphics, to reduce distraction, and clear up visual noise.  Have the players be normal graphics and the walls be simple colours and textures.
In CS I always preferred to watch the POV of my favourite players, rather than the whole game.  Likewise, when I watch OW I prefer to watch guys like SoOn rather than the story of the team's progress.

esports needs solutions for both hardcore and casual fans.

Sad to see kNg removed from his team, as he is a skilled player, but this just one in a long strong of mistakes on his part.

Let's hope in his next team we can just talk about his play and not his tweets.
felps is one of the most talented players outside of the top 2-3 teams in the world, so I'm certainly glad to see him join 100T, but it's disappointing it's at the expense of kNg, who was a revelation last year.

A thread about the viewing figures of a Dota2 event is at the top of the CS:GO subreddit right now and has been up for over 7 hours.

Remember that the mods delete all content not directly related to CS:GO, though.
"I'm a huge fan of esports but I won't ever pay a cent of my own money for it and yet I want only my needs to be catered to on a daily basis even though I'm basically communicating to you I'm only good for a fraction of a cent from raw viewing figures"

You just know TL and Astralis will get drawn with each other next and Astralis will get the traditional free win off them.
Let's see.  Jags are almost built to win this game.  Sick defense and then their offense is all about rushing, which is Pats' biggest flaw on defense.

Imagine how hilarious it would have been if kNg had gone with something like "Sorry about the volume, we knew you weren't at the major so we thought it was okay for us Brazilians to make as much noise as we want now :>"
People are going to make jokes online, so either you avoid seeing them so you don't get triggered or you take control of the narrative by using the joke to your advantage.
Mod thinking is pretty clear:

"Is this insulting someone I don't like?  Ok, I'm gonna look the other way"

"This one is insulting someone I do like?  Let me get my rule book out, gotta be some way to justify removing it."
Reminder that r/globaloffensive mods literally left up a thread called something like "can we talk about Thorin on twitter?" where it was 100s of insults, practically all unrelated to CS:GO.
Classic banterhttps://clips.twitch.tv/GracefulSteamyNigiriPeanutButterJellyTime …
I remember when mods deleted all the threads about stuff I did and said.  JK, never happened.
I'd advise against contacting 100Thieves or Nadeshot. There's no reason a little banter should hurt kNg's career further. He's gradually learning which topics to avoid.

With that said, I think he still doesn't get that it's his own tweets that damage it.
If you're a pro who doesn't like jokes being made on twitter then coming at me is a mistake because I am your reckoning.
Yeah, you're right that we've both done things wrong. The difference is that I apologised to the people I said something wrong to.

I don't think that's what Jacob is suggesting.  He seems to be just highlighting a fear that players will see it as a way of not having to speak to the media, which is not ideal for anyone.
They basically interview him and then use creative license to put together a piece as he might have said it, if he had the skillset to structure his thoughts and convey them as elegantly.
Which is not what the player tribune is.  That site uses skilled journalists as ghost writers to interpret what the player likely meant in more elegant language.  It's almost like players need the help of skilled journalists to convey their thoughts :>

Fair enough. Definitely don't consider myself an expert on this specific topic, as I have not been involved with companies on that level, but I think the general direction is a clear positive. Execution of this specific deal is another matter yet to be seen.
I assumed by your reply to him that the implication was that he shouldn't comment on this matter since he doesn't know if it's a good move.
What arguments have you put forwards as to why this specific deal is on balance a bad thing?
-Better pay for talent
-More talent to be hired
-Additional shoulder content for events
-Better stage setups
-More promotion
If you think the only change as a result of this scenario is a lower viewer count and ESL making more money you have no clue about the esports industry.

This can allow:
-higher prize pools
-longer events
-better formats
-a bigger circuithttps://twitter.com/jiffoe/status/953993137076174848 …

The above is all LoL-related.

Then you contrast them with the old Lunatic-Hai and you see why team FPS is so exciting.  It's very rare that an all-star skill line-up is actually better than a real cohesive team.

Also why 99% of people judging on-camera analysis are a joke, since they don't realise it's not the same as being sat at home in front of a PC able to look stuff up.
I thought SZPERO would one day be a player who got a chance in VP, since he would bring an AWPing threat they've lacked for some time.

Would assume the first CS:GO events on Facebook will have serious teething problems, but YouTube was a fantastic viewing experience and people just moved the goal posts and never mentioned as much.
Probably the most pathetic aspect of the dota fb backlash is those pretending their concern is the health and growth of esports, as opposed to their selfish personal viewing experience.
There's the complete failure to observe context that typifies dota fans :>
You will get mega down-voted and possibly set a record for down-votes. Godspeed.
I love teams who have changed players a bunch of times telling VP they don't need to make a change.  No skin in the game.

NEO was terrible at the major but, as usual, crickets from everyone about that. Amazing how many people think they're brave but daren't call out CS:GO royalty.
The two most under-rated factors at the major:
-Lots of play-off rookies about to feel the pressure.
-G2 have blitzed the tournament but only played one top team in 6 maps.
"If you like facebook so much then why don't you stream on it?"

Yes, shame he refuses to commit to English.  If he had put in real effort one year ago he could be leader of a mouz/OpTic by now.  I have orgs ask me all the time for IGL suggestions.
Doesn't sound like he has much choice then :>
G2 are mentally broken.  Classic tilt and hesitation play from the French.  This is French teams at majors for the last 2 years.  Don't let them getting a super easy run fool you.

ELEAGUE gave you 100T's rooms by mistake :>
For all the complaining about lack of time off over the last few years I think that excuse has masked that most modern teams don't actually know how to prepare with a few weeks off to be in good shape and peak without burning out.
Somehow making a miracle run and getting out of swiss would be the worst thing that could possibly happen to VP right now.  This is an early elimination that needed to come at the last major already.
Weird cos idiots tell me every year that any good player would look like kennyS on Titan, NiKo on mouz and s1mple on Na`Vi if their team sucked.  Wonder what these Polish players are waiting for?
21 year old MICHU, who has never for even a solid month managed to look god-like on his Polish teams.
Some pro players in CS:GO suggested it was not and the type of game you play, both literally and in terms of your style of play, matters.
A key detail people ignore is that a component of why Swiss is bad at majors is not just the lack of reseeding but also that we use garbage seeding (Legends spots) that fuck up the first round match-ups as well.  From there the machine just runs into a wall.

Me: "Maybe there is so much pressure at majors that even the top teams play more shakily in Swiss"

Fans: "Nah, clearly the level of play just goes up massively every major, even tho these teams who get crazy upsets do fuck all at all subsequent LANs"

#FanLogic
It's like some anime shit that NiKo and coldzera are not only god-like players still but both lost weight over a similar time-span.  All we need now is for them to fall in love with the same girl.
Stupid thing about how underwhelming Na`Vi has been is if they were a solid team they would automatically gain a fear factor from teams who know s1mple will go off.
Having the three Korean teams in OWL makes strength of schedule even more significant when evaluating teams right now.
Nice to see that three of the favourites are 2:0.  Shame only one of FaZe and SK can go 3:0.  Hope the bracket doesn't end up fucked up a la PGL Krakow.
Let's not forget the most famous and stupid #FanLogic regarding using other broadcasters:

BIG is a great example of how worthless tactics and good personal chemistry are without enough people who are skilled enough to be able to shoot bullets into the other team.

We've had majors in Sweden, Germany, USA, Romania and Poland so far.  Denmark has been one of the most significant countries in CS:GO history, is a great place to visit and has the public base which would provide a good crowd.
I would like the next CS:GO major to be hosted by ESL or Dreamhack and in Denmark.  I would name check MLG too, but it seems as if they aren't getting one any time soon if ever.
NFL analysis is great right up until they start comparing quarterbacks based on rings and play-off records, as if you could put Brady on the Browns and somehow he'd still win play-off games.

No point complaining about a bad bracket draw at a major.  Like Ray Lewis said: "If you're great, then show it".
Good!
FaZe has the most free bracket you could ever get in a major, practically.  What luck!
Crazy to think we'll see Astralis at the stage of the next major that used to be the qualifier.  Then again, they were playing under difficult circumstances and we're still waiting for device to be device again.
grats
KRiMZ actually has insane stats thus-far too, averaging over a kill per round but with low deaths.
It's fitting that olof and KRiMZ both kept their play-off streaks alive, but on different teams.
For those wanting context for that final:

Cloud9 played amazing but this tournament was nothing like their form over last few months. They need to prove they can do this again.

FaZe can only be disappointed without the title, that's the level they operate at.
NiKo is going to end his career as one of the best players to ever compete in Counter-Strike and he's still young but that final was bullshit from him. When you're great you have to show it.

28:43 over the first two maps.
Great choice by C9 to go to inferno rather than cache.  FaZe dominating inferno is burned into my minds but they are finally vulnerable on it now.
Astralis wasn't Astralis this tournament, even down to the roles.
The switch-up of putting an AWP in Stewie's hands in B was a key adaptation.  Then they trusted they didn't need to over-rotate and waited for real contact.
Plus, look at this very match here.  C9 couldn't buy a map vs. FaZe and now they outplayed them on like 2.5 maps in the final.
FaZe doesn't need to beat SK to win a major.  Think how few majors had 1 vs. 2 in the final or at any point in the bracket.
GuardiaN and olof don't choke in majors.  Damn they showed up today.
GuardiaN has been the best player in two major finals (DH Cluj and here) and come up empty both times.  Fate is fickle but that's what makes victory so sweet.
I propose this final be dubbed "The miracle in Mass".

I still get people to this day who will contradict my statements with comments sources from PR statements when I have been told otherwise, privately, by the player in question and others directly involved.
When you read a thread reporting a roster move remember that the people commenting there have on dozens of occasions believed orgs telling them a move isn't happening which then happened and then believed said org after-the-fact that it was coincidence.
That's a list of organisations who still don't know what esports is.
SK are set to have a tough time themselves being as half their direct threats are set to shuffle in the next few months to find a better compisition. That's how team disciplines work: you have a window.
The analysis that FaZe or other top teams can't win any more tournaments because SK exists is beyond weak.  SK have won three tournaments and people talk like they're in some impossible 70 game winning streak.
Then attack his points and that behaviour but this is not relevant.
Literally explicitly not a list of Jewish people but rather a list of people where some happen to Jewish and some are not.

Let's hope Worlds gives us Rookie vs. bdd
For those wanting context for that final:

Cloud9 played amazing but this tournament was nothing like their form over last few months. They need to prove they can do this again.

FaZe can only be disappointed without the title, that's the level they operate at.
NiKo is going to end his career as one of the best players to ever compete in Counter-Strike and he's still young but that final was bullshit from him. When you're great you have to show it.

28:43 over the first two maps.
Great choice by C9 to go to inferno rather than cache.  FaZe dominating inferno is burned into my minds but they are finally vulnerable on it now.
Astralis wasn't Astralis this tournament, even down to the roles.
The switch-up of putting an AWP in Stewie's hands in B was a key adaptation.  Then they trusted they didn't need to over-rotate and waited for real contact.
Plus, look at this very match here.  C9 couldn't buy a map vs. FaZe and now they outplayed them on like 2.5 maps in the final.
FaZe doesn't need to beat SK to win a major.  Think how few majors had 1 vs. 2 in the final or at any point in the bracket.
GuardiaN and olof don't choke in majors.  Damn they showed up today.
GuardiaN has been the best player in two major finals (DH Cluj and here) and come up empty both times.  Fate is fickle but that's what makes victory so sweet.
I propose this final be dubbed "The miracle in Mass".

#ELEAGUEMajor
Some if the FaZe players did crumble at key points but there should never be sour grapes after a classic like that. Be grateful you were a part of a match that will be remembered by over 1,000,000 people.
Great job in the final @jamesbardolph and @followddk. You made me a believer.
Great series in the final, @C9Skadoodle. You're the reason NA has a major title. Tons of clutch AWP shots.
.@Cloud9 won the major by beating the three best teams in the tournament in Bo3 series. Can't fuck with that.

Respect @tarik @C9Skadoodle @Stewie @RUSH @autimaticTV!
.@guardiancsgo is my MVP for the ELEAGUE Major Boston. You played like a champion, my man.
Cloud9 deserved that. Shit, there's no losers in a game like that.
Lot of Trump fans in the crowd
You switch up more than a badly raised pit

3 T rounds vs. full buy is so tough on this map. FaZe under serious pressure. Let's see if they've learned they aren't baiting out C9's utility.
This guy was one of the first public faces of CS:GO from the devs when the game was launched.pic.twitter.com/I4WfNncBca

People want to attack byali for playing PUBG and LoL but don't get it twisted and start making out like he's the worst player in the team.  He did work in 2017 and, along with pasha, was one of the only ones keeping them from drowning, at times.
Travis was just Doublelift's handler during the CLG times.  Steve is in control now.
"I can't tell you that shit or I'd have to kill you, Western mothafucka"
Modern media approach of sometimes constructing a narrative entirely out of thin air relies on knowing due to info overload that a lot of people don't want to admit they didn't see or read something and will simply take their opinions from the media's accounts.
I would congratulate kuki for his English but the most fluent Korean player we've found so far doesn't have a twitter account?  Oh dear, @SeoulDynasty!

"FNC vs. Na'Vi? Where are olof and GuardiaN? They play together?  In FaZe???"
Hope Astralis-C9 is a fuckin bloodbath
Welcome back to the play-offs @G2shox.  Make this one count!

À qui il a été beaucoup donné, il sera beaucoup demandé.
You were fair.  People close to Bjergsen are going to take the criticism personally, but you did your job of being as honest analytically as you could be.  You are not to blame for those who take their criticism too far.
Nine nationalities in this major Ro8 series.  What a crazy scene CS:GO has become!
Darien from Gambit was sad FaZe lost that round

Good to hear.  Have a good show, mate.
Dear TOs,
  Please don't end analysis desk segments early to throw to casters when the game is not live.

Love
People who enjoy analysis
Hate the mirage ban second rotation from karrigan.  Leave mirage so you get it as the decider and have your best current map for comfort vs. the rookies.
Two teams play in a match and I don't see any guarantees mouz does well under pressure in their first major Ro8 on a map like cbble.
Enjoy giving mouz their best possible chance to start the series 1:0.
Ballsy cache pick from karrigan.  I think picking inferno would have been the safer choice, but vs. play-off rookies it's not a bad idea to throw them off.
I hope one day we have analysis segments for play-off series that are a solid 30-45 min pre-game show, so talent of this level can really break the game down.
sgares just agreed with ChrisJ that nobody on FaZe is better than oskar.  What the fuck?
No surprise to see notable figures in the Brazilian scene excusing kNg's behaviour and acting as if he had no choice but to behave that way in response to a joke.

That refusal to accept responsibility is a big reason their scene has had so many problems.
mouz are not a budget FaZe cos they don't have anyone close to karrigan.  In terms of the top 4 vs. the top 4 players they are a budget FaZe.
Hope we see a cheeky nuke ban from karrigan and dare mouz to pick cbble.
mouz's ECS series vs. FaZe is so over-rated.  They over-performed on inferno and their mirage was all about suNny going ham.  That narrow loss took oskar being the best player in the server over three maps too.

Not gonna happen again.
Almost like they are morons who complained without knowing even the most rudimentary facts.
Literally 99% of the morons raging:

a) clearly didn't read these rules
b) don't care anyway
c) don't understand the concept of property rights
lol at paying for the game entitling you to free entertainment provided by someone entirely unrelated to the game developer and at a cost of millions to them.  It's like these fucks get stupider as you go.
Your community might be dogshit if your fanbase legitimately complains that illegal restreams are shut down, on the basis that their language doesn't have an official stream.
Looking forward to hearing @seangares's analysis for the major.  One of my favourites to listen to.
In CS:GO I'd agree, but I think NEO was the MJ of 1.6.  His team were the underdog in most of their major finals and he won the majority he played in and always performed well.
That's why guys like Mark Cuban aren't investing in esports right now.
Also, remind me which ESL event you did recently, Tomi.  Almost like this guy doesn't watch the tournaments :>
Only a moron would interpret that term literally, being as it has an established history in television.
The metaphor of Riot having broken the game is no longer a metaphor.https://twitter.com/RustyLoL/status/956091344572706816 …
Thorin's Thoughts - Respect What the Major Represents (CS:GO)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54hY97lwosM …
That's a good point, though.
You also have to sacrifice a social life or already not have one, due to being a life-long nerd. I don't know that esports is in a good enough place where I would recommend anyone aspire to be a pro in it. I think it should only be for those who feel compelled.
"Can you guys change the format of the tournament, which has already been running for two weeks, and have the final be a Bo5 instead of a Bo3?"

I still get people to this day who will contradict my statements with comments sources from PR statements when I have been told otherwise, privately, by the player in question and others directly involved.
When you read a thread reporting a roster move remember that the people commenting there have on dozens of occasions believed orgs telling them a move isn't happening which then happened and then believed said org after-the-fact that it was coincidence.
That's a list of organisations who still don't know what esports is.
SK are set to have a tough time themselves being as half their direct threats are set to shuffle in the next few months to find a better compisition. That's how team disciplines work: you have a window.
The analysis that FaZe or other top teams can't win any more tournaments because SK exists is beyond weak.  SK have won three tournaments and people talk like they're in some impossible 70 game winning streak.
Then attack his points and that behaviour but this is not relevant.
Literally explicitly not a list of Jewish people but rather a list of people where some happen to Jewish and some are not.

Is this really the best you can do? Maybe point out next that Hitler breathed air and so did this guy?

Moron who doesn't know anyone involved in the situation: assume you know what Thorin knows.
"I know this happened because [person X] said so"

Imagine if you weren't a pleb and actually knew other people involved in the story.  Presumably you'd take on board some of the things they said.

Now imagine that's what my situation is.

"Why are you bringing that up now?"

Cos you guys definitely don't like bringing things up from the past about people :>

What were the three adaptations that allowed C9 to win the deciding map?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SyCfMTKuh8 …
Then you have paid literally no attention this story nor listened to the accounts of the very people involved.
You know what I'd do if my colleagues told me they were going to commit a crime during our next team project?  Refuse to participate and/or leave the team.

Then again, I have these pesky things called morals.
-Play in a game your team-mates have said they are throwing
-Refuse to AWP, despite being primary AWPer
-Decline spoils of your crime for any reason

Fan reaction: It's not a crime if you didn't accept the skins.

Sad to see Koreans have also begun a war on language which will now destroy the ability to use metaphor, arguably language's most powerful and meaningful device.

Get help, seriously. For the sake of those around you at the very least.
One thing that makes @YNk realer than 99.9999999999% is that as an analyst he doesn't give a fuck about predictions and realises nobody has a high rate cos there's no connection with game analysis.

I use them to play to the crowd but the real heads know.
Glad to be wrong any time it's a classic match like that.

Understand that to this very day kNg still claims he did nothing wrong and that it was FNS who did something wrong.
He is a bad guy cos he threatened to kill someone, then tried to find and do harm to that person, then refused to apologise for any of that or acknowledge it as a mistake.  Later he used a homophobic line of insult and again refused to apologise.https://twitter.com/rodsbezerra/status/959002463088136192 …
I love all these comments "I'm sure kNg isn't a bad guy".  At this point what could he do to convince he is?

Every public action and statement we've seen from him has been stupid at best and malevolent at worst.

This is a systematic agenda which has the goal of  forcing tokenism to appease them, the leverage point being that the big companies in esports will get frustrated with the never-ending stream of bad publicity in the mainstream.
If you legitimately think mainstream games journalists woke up and decided esports was cool and are innocently putting out all these articles which always stress a lack of female pros and too many white men, you're beyond naive.

Any manager or org staff member who thinks all of their pro players are telling them their private plans and discussions with other teams is beyond delusional.  Stay in your lane.
At this point I hope everyone is done with that fuckin North guy who is always all over the place denying everything, half the time cos he isn't in the loop himself on what players are doing, then claims the exact same moves just coincidentally happened later.
Do what you want the rest of the year but don't ever compromise the integrity of your major campaign and potentially cost yourself and your team-mates a chance to win a historic world championship.
The sheer amount of huge blockbuster roster moves I heard swirling around regarding teams with a chance to win the major but before a single game had been played was really disappointing to me.
My point is that the intention of some members of a team not to make changes does not mean those changes will not happen.  Most roster moves are kept secret by the parties involved until the moment they are activated.
Now you see why it means nothing when teams say "we won't make any roster moves".

Thinking and constructing nuanced arguments is my domain.  In this place I am coldzera and you're shara.
Ok, I can see you're going to be a child and completely ignore the context of my statements to argue against strawmen.
Maybe you can just post that pic of me wearing the nV hoodie from like 2.5 years ago and claim that means I think nV are number one now? :>
If you're going to attempt to join an argument it's considered polite to figure out the context of the points people are making before attempting to argue against them.
I have definitely never said that failing to qualify for a LAN means the placings of the teams at the LAN do not count for their ranking. Try again.
Failing to qualify means by definition you placed below the team who won the event.  That's a fact.
By the logic of SK fans, SK in 2016 was never at any moment the number 1 team since they didn't beat FNATIC.

I should get a passport from an NA country, seems to be like the sunglasses from They Live.
Narratives are a hell of a drug.
FaZe must be the luckiest team in the world to fluke their way to four straight championship points while being "outplayed".
Simultaneous to NiKo, one of the consistently most dominant carries in the game and someone who had feasted on C9 previously, having a poor series by his standards.

Yeah.
This is weak af.

Oh, so it was "only" their worst player over-performing and literally having the best stats in a three map series vs. FaZe, one of the most skilled teams in the game?
A Brazilian fan literally told me today that I'm a coward for apologising when I said something wrong.

The Patriots could have won all of the superbowls they lost and lost all of the superbowls they won.

Painting a hard narrative like they were comprehensively better or worse in each single instance is worthless and obscures real analysis.
Media furore before and after superbowl shows how dumb sports analysis is.

Before the game Brady was the GOAT QB who couldn't lose.

Afterwards people were making out like he failed.  Was easily one of his best performances.

Single variable analysis is garbage.

I should get a passport from an NA country, seems to be like the sunglasses from They Live.
Narratives are a hell of a drug.
FaZe must be the luckiest team in the world to fluke their way to four straight championship points while being "outplayed".
Simultaneous to NiKo, one of the consistently most dominant carries in the game and someone who had feasted on C9 previously, having a poor series by his standards.

Yeah.
This is weak af.

Oh, so it was "only" their worst player over-performing and literally having the best stats in a three map series vs. FaZe, one of the most skilled teams in the game?
A Brazilian fan literally told me today that I'm a coward for apologising when I said something wrong.

That explains a lot.

As moses pointed out in his AMA: Anders and Semmler actually took a pay cut at a CS:GO major in order to get him hired for it.  Let me know any other esport with a talent group like that.
They are bigots.  Things will only change when rather than defending against their ludicrous statements people actually start calling them what they objectively are: racists, sexists etc.

If you hear Cloud9 fans talk you'd legit think they 2:0'd FaZe and kept them in single digits.

"C9 were just clearly better".

Game I saw went three maps, had C9 facing championship point for FaZe 4 rounds in a row and then was won in overtime.

No surprise that's never reported on by the mainstream gaming sites, though.  Almost like they're not actually involved in esports at all and just pick the most public low hanging fruit to fit their bullshit political narrative.
Anyone who thinks the CS community only goes after those who "bait" them buys the bullshit narrative those very ppl use as an excuse

Never seen Emilia Hult antagonise  the community and yet she gets a never-ending string of rude and unacceptable comments.
S5 has to be the wackest season ever for jungle.  Just look at some of the names who were on top teams in their regions: TBQ, Lee/Hojin, Santorin, loulex.  For Worlds especially that was such an appalling Jungle field.

You're welcome to disagree, with zero information to base your judgement on, but I would bet very good money that the sponsorship potential of that EL final, which was the highest viewed twitch channel stream ever, is worth significantly less than ESL's fb deal.
C9's win is reminiscent of FNATIC's at the first major:

Top 5 but underdog team overcomes number 2 team in the world, who are thought to be a shoe-in for the title.  Do so with decisive moves and lesser names making key plays.

I've worked in esports for 16 years professionally and not only have I never seen this individual involved in any capacity but my expert opinion is that their commentary has been asinine and wilfully ignorant.
inferno third maps and both teams leaving thinking there were 2-3 rounds they should have gotten vs. the other team
Let's see if some of the bonkers roster swaps I heard about pre-major come through now.  All the relevant teams lost at the right spots in the tournament to make them a possibility.
What does owning a game studio, which itself is a massive stretch the way it is being presented there, have to do with esports?  If I own a garage it doesn't make me an expert on Formula 1 and its industry.
Yellow and black dress next major, love.
Here's a scary thought:

NiKo is already a fucking monster and this is the kind of loss that can teach a guy like that the final lesson in poise that makes them unbeatable.

20 years old.
C9 winning was a perfect example of a scenario where a player from the losing team is the MVP. Over the tournament, C9 had a solid team effort from their big 4 and then the other guy had the best final.

GuardiaN was a monster all tournament long.
Anyone who claims they knew C9 were gonna win that final but didn't place a wager when the odds were INSANE for them has an opinion worth the $0.00 they invested into it :>

Understand that to this very day kNg still claims he did nothing wrong and that it was FNS who did something wrong.
He is a bad guy cos he threatened to kill someone, then tried to find and do harm to that person, then refused to apologise for any of that or acknowledge it as a mistake.  Later he used a homophobic line of insult and again refused to apologise.https://twitter.com/rodsbezerra/status/959002463088136192 …
I love all these comments "I'm sure kNg isn't a bad guy".  At this point what could he do to convince he is?

This is a systematic agenda which has the goal of  forcing tokenism to appease them, the leverage point being that the big companies in esports will get frustrated with the never-ending stream of bad publicity in the mainstream.
If you legitimately think mainstream games journalists woke up and decided esports was cool and are innocently putting out all these articles which always stress a lack of female pros and too many white men, you're beyond naive.

I have definitely never said that failing to qualify for a LAN means the placings of the teams at the LAN do not count for their ranking. Try again.
Failing to qualify means by definition you placed below the team who won the event.  That's a fact.

Any manager or org staff member who thinks all of their pro players are telling them their private plans and discussions with other teams is beyond delusional.  Stay in your lane.
At this point I hope everyone is done with that fuckin North guy who is always all over the place denying everything, half the time cos he isn't in the loop himself on what players are doing, then claims the exact same moves just coincidentally happened later.
Do what you want the rest of the year but don't ever compromise the integrity of your major campaign and potentially cost yourself and your team-mates a chance to win a historic world championship.
The sheer amount of huge blockbuster roster moves I heard swirling around regarding teams with a chance to win the major but before a single game had been played was really disappointing to me.
My point is that the intention of some members of a team not to make changes does not mean those changes will not happen.  Most roster moves are kept secret by the parties involved until the moment they are activated.
Now you see why it means nothing when teams say "we won't make any roster moves".
That's just Dota2, mate.  Contrasing with CS:GO is like back when we only knew about NiP fans and we thought "fuck, it can't get much worse, right?" and then along came a certain fanbase around November of 2015 :>
I hope it is everything you wanted it to be.

I don't even understand the London part.  A middle finger in the UK is considered highly offensive and usually means "sit on this".
If Faker was a normal star player they would legit finish 5th-6th this split.
Yep, got my wires crossed.
Seems I had the user this guy was replying to muted, so I didn't realise he was actually suggesting I apologised in a facebook post, which is correct.

Sorry, my dude. @13thforswarnhttps://twitter.com/Thooorin/status/956731491047952384 …
I couldn't care less if he apologised to the fans. They are not who he said something fucked up to.  Do you even understand the basic premise of how apologies work @13thforswarn?
I apologised in the language of the people I insulted with my comments.  kNg has not apologised to me in English for his comment.

His tweet was to me, so his apology should be too.https://twitter.com/13thforswarn/status/956726852411936770 …
The difference between kNg and me is that when I fucked up, making a joke that had an implication which was unacceptable, I apologised publicly.  

kNg has still yet to apologise to the people he said unacceptable things to.
No matter the lies that are repeated, here are the facts:

I did not tweet about kNg in the situation in question.  I did not address him or tag him.  I made a joke about his team to someone else.

kNg directly tweeted a homophobic joke to my twitter account.
I appreciate the sentiment but it's in no way your fault and you shouldn't have to feel responsible for their actions.

They are the ones who should be held accountable for what they choose to do, which is the lesson some still have not learned.https://twitter.com/RafaelSantti/status/956722851918249984 …
So I guess I'm not fine with it, in as much as I wouldn't have handled it that way.  With that said, I don't know Ryu's motivations in making those comments.  I would probably just handle it privately, like you said, or live and let live.
That's a tough one cos I think it's a personal preference issue for what kind of person you want to be.  I try to not say things publicly which were told to me in confidence or which are explicitly private, such as what people do off-camera.
Not sure who you're referring to, so I don't know the context of the scenario in question.
I also reached out to kNg privately during all of that to try and help him understand that he was endangering his career with that kind of behaviour and that it's fine to trash talk me but some cultures will not accept comments like that.

Done with the guy now.

It's also been a consistent trend with Brazilians that when they insult me online their go-to insult is to suggest I am a homosexual.  That's not only criminally shit as banter but clearly not cool in the tone and nature of the premise's application.
Then the same individual is now claiming I have defamed him.  Despite a) not having apologised still to me for that comment and b) proudly reiterating again that he has not and will not apologise to FNS for threatening to kill him.
What kNg said wasn't the end of the world, it just added to his string of past fuck-ups, but ppl acting if it was fine is ridiculous.

His attempt at a diss was literally to suggest I am a homosexual with a boyfriend and imply that's somehow an insult.

There's also a key distinction to be drawn between individual failures along the way and whether or not the direction itself has merit and leads somewhere positive.
It's entirely legitimate to be sceptical of TOs changing broadcast partner and especially trying new partners, who lack experience in the esports space.

What's not acceptable or respectable is throwing a tantrum cos you want the world to remain as it is.
Attacking someone presenting a different opinion to you is both lazy and unproductive. It's key, from my perspective, to ascertain whether they are legitimately open to discussion or an ideologue. In latter case it's simply conservation of energy to ignore.

Massive pistol for FaZe. Let's see some ballsy forces from C9.
Did someone buy two m4s and gun run them to B due to having money at the end of the half so he could spray and then swap out? Cool idea if so.
FaZe are at their best when they give you a new look each CT round. Slows opponents right down due to making them paranoid.
Nobody asks more questions to get insight from the green room.https://twitter.com/davidchen10/status/957737268269207552 …
NiKo's spray is dialed in. FaZe are coming for the half.
I always told @OnFireAnders back in 2014 that if I could pick any player's skills to have I'd pick GuardiaN cos you feel like no shot is impossible for his AWP.
FaZe should consider rotating olof to B some rounds. He can play it and NiKo's spray is sick so he'd be fine holding pit.

Jokes aside, I feel for any player who chokes in a massive game. Most fans have no clue what thst pressure is like.

This isn't like reading a book report in front of your class. You're playing the best players in the world and they'll feast on your misfortune.

Every great player should play in a major final third map at some point in their career so we see how they'd do under the ultimate pressure.

The NBA game 7 equivalent of esports.
FaZe were gods of inferno for a solid couple of months but they've levelled right off in the last 2. C9 looking for the magic they produced yesterday vs. SK.
Everyone in this final is feeling the pressure. That's a big reason so few major finals are legit classics. One team chokes and it's one-sided or both do and you get messy games.
Love how ballsy FaZe are playing now. Put the pressure on C9, who now look shook. autimatic cooled right off.
That window is shut and NiKo is spreading his cheeks on it.
Here he comes. NiKo is in the building. He pulled an IMT and showed up late, but he's here now.
C9 need to close this fast cos if NiKo wakes up fully then that window closes real fast.

It's fine to give a hot take and then later, when you encounter more information and context, change your mind, but it's disappointing how often public discourse involves people outright lying about what their original opinions/positions were.
This also seems suspiciously like walking a story back for people to now suggest their main concern was the labelling and not some notion that the product was dangerous.

It's clear to me that most commenting think other products contain zero traces of lead.
The labelling issue will of course have to be addressed in court. He is presumably responding to hysteria, some of which came from well known figures in esports, that Gfuel is somehow "tainted" with lead and thus will harm or kill you.
Hope the Brady fans who, rightfully, were upset over the defense in the SB now understand how disingenuous they've been for the last 15+ years in dismissing the exact same complaints when comparing Brady to Rogers, Brees and to a lesser degree Manning.

Pretty insane to think that the EliGE-Twistzz combo has beaten SK Gaming teams who were ranked top 2 at the time in 3 out of 4 offline Bo3 series in just over five months and the only loss was a close third map OT decider.

NA is growing up!
You know it's fine SK lost at summit, right?  It's not even close to the end of the world.  It's only funny cos some elements of their fanbase talked so much shit like they were unkillable gods and mocked FaZe for daring to lose to anyone else.

SK will be back.
Now we've got a final.  Crazy to think we might be entering a world where C9 pivot from train to inferno instead.
There also need to be concessions made for people legitimately not from our culture when they clearly show remorse that they didn't understand the implications of a joke.
Just cos your feelings got hurt or you got outraged doesn't make it a crime or a punishable offense.  Being an asshole is not illegal.  Believe me, I know! :>
Are people so desperate to cry racism that pointing out that the USA dropped a nuke on Japan or that there is zika in Brazil are racist?  Pretty sure those are just facts which ended up being using in bad jokes.

Big difference between rude and racist.
You will be back. You guys are too good not to.  Let's see if they can bring the same game they showed today!
It's unfair that SK didn't have to play any Bo3s today :>
Funny thing is TL's win was comparable to C9's major win in that it was a team effort with really solid fragging from everyone concerned.
SK lost three of their last four Bo3 series vs. NA teams and their win was vs. Torqued.
SK? More like SKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
The top 2 NA CS:GO line-ups have never had this much skill stacked in them and relative to the top EU sides.
Helps that this match is not at a tournament with a big stage set-up or huge prestige.  Removes some of SK's advantages.  No real reason for TL players to feel pressure.
Before we get the "it's the first tournament" complaint, remember that SK claimed to have been praccing with boltz over felps the entire time and not changing many positions.

Can't have it both ways, bruh.
FaZe always answered C9 forces with their own previously on inferno but this FaZe has been way too tight and those rain and NiKo deagles didn't properly arrive today.
How do I get that gig? I'll retire from everything else tomorrow
Pretty sick to think they played in the same team!
If I'm C9 I'm rushing B as much as possible this half.  NiKo is mega tilted and karrigan is playing there most rounds too.  Make NiKo perform or crumble further.
NiKo: Hello, Cloud?  I'd like to dominate you like I always do and win a major.

C9: Nope

NiKo: Understandable, have a nice day.
He was already a prime candidate anyway, so it's looking good.
FaZe have an insane CT side on overpass but NiKo is so key for them at the B site and right now he is choking like device and nex's love child.
C9 have already done two things they've never done against FaZe before:

-won the first half
-won the CT side of overpass
You'll remember these flicks
Better fadeaway than DeMar DeRozan
C9 in their past games vs. FaZe were at their best on ecos and force-buys, as bizarre as that might sound.  Plenty of nearly impossible rounds won from those, in contrast to their shallow pool of gun rounds won.
Which leads to them playing passively in the sites, which is exactly what FaZe want.  FaZe love the slow pushes, throwing all their utility to draw out CT utility and then taking dry aim duels together in the sites.
C9's CT side vs. FaZe often struggles cos they try to play aggro buy FaZe are very happy to double face and trade, knowing CTs lose more in wars of attrition which end even.
autimatic was -28 over the three overpass games played vs. FaZe.  Different game for him so far.
NiKo and GuardiaN are FaZe's dominant players on overpass vs. C9 and NiKo has yet to show up to the final at all
FaZe-C9 games always saw FaZe winning the first half by double digits previously, including 11 or more round T halves on overpass.

C9 usually hung in there early but got blasted as the game went on.  Great start so far for them.
And you've contracted American Dreams,
I require you to stop and look up.
GuardiaN has played in one major final he was solo carrying in (Dreamhack Cluj) and another he was literally unable to play close to his best at due to injury (MLG).  Now is his time to get that major title that he deserved long ago.https://twitter.com/HLTVorg/status/957717342724571137 …
It's wack people can act like FaZe inexplicably almost getting beaten on their best map is just C9 being 10x better on it overnight and yet simultaneously Stewie feeding is due to pressure, which apparently only exists for C9.

#FanLogic
My favourite part about the hot takes for map 1 of this final is that we have literally never seen either team in these circumstances before, playing in a major final.  Hardly crazy to think pressure is playing a significant role nobody could perfectly anticipate.

The banter in the C9-TL thread is pretty good.  Tons of good jokes and references.
C9 losing summit obv is no drastic strike against their major win, but hopefully it suggests to some of their more ardent supporters that their major victory was not the result of some genius read of the meta and completely strategically outplaying the top teams.
Let's film a new channel ident where you say the same thing "this is tarik and I play for [my team] and we will be the best team in [this year]" but this time it can actually be serious and not for comedy purposes!

IIRC this was actually a competition online where fans voted for or wrote in their burger designs and the NiP burger won, due to a massive push from NiP fans.

Thorin's 1336th law:

If a matter in a field you have no background or expertise in seems simple to decide or has an obvious answer which others miss then that perception is simply a product of your lack of understanding of the nuance of that field.
Worse is that this process is often sped up by simply deciding that single factor at the outset, without even cursory reading or research into the other factors involved.
Reading political hot takes of ppl I follow the same pattern emerges again and again: take a massively complicated matter which involves dozens of often specialised factors and reduce them all down to a single factor by which they decide the "obvious" answer.
Simplest way to put it is like this: let's say dennis isn't a good IGL. Well odds are he is better than at least 2-3 of the current NiP players, so we'll swap his role and recruit a new player to replace them, which is now easier with a better piece in place.
It's the same reason I've always been in favour of NA sports franchises drafting the best player they can get, not just drafting for what they need short-term.  You can do a lot more with a good player whether he fits in your team or not.
One point I forgot to make in my dennis to NiP video which is key is that sometimes teams should recruit based on getting talent, even if it isn't exactly what they need.

You can pivot and change a different piece later, retaining the newly acquired piece.
As ever: judge a man by his actions more than his words.

The most worthless reddit comments imaginable have to be the ones which simply assert someone is entirely wrong without addressing any of their points or even citing which ones they are talking about.
Presumably it's the standard American shit where someone sued them for megabucks and thus they are legally required to put the warning on.
Jack's real genius wasn't even in putting together a roster which just won a major, but rather getting them to sign three year deals, which now gives him all of the power.
Remember before the major when tons of people were claiming it wasn't a real major or didn't count due to SK not being at full strength?  That talk sure dried up quick once Cloud9 won it.

dennis was basically the one that got away for NiP.  If he hadn't retired to work in the Summer of 2014 then I think he was the most logical choice to replace fifflaren.  Especially he had already played with f0rest and GTR in 1.6.

Pretty insane to think that the EliGE-Twistzz combo has beaten SK Gaming teams who were ranked top 2 at the time in 3 out of 4 offline Bo3 series in just over five months and the only loss was a close third map OT decider.

NA is growing up!
You know it's fine SK lost at summit, right?  It's not even close to the end of the world.  It's only funny cos some elements of their fanbase talked so much shit like they were unkillable gods and mocked FaZe for daring to lose to anyone else.

SK will be back.
Now we've got a final.  Crazy to think we might be entering a world where C9 pivot from train to inferno instead.
There also need to be concessions made for people legitimately not from our culture when they clearly show remorse that they didn't understand the implications of a joke.
Just cos your feelings got hurt or you got outraged doesn't make it a crime or a punishable offense.  Being an asshole is not illegal.  Believe me, I know! :>
Are people so desperate to cry racism that pointing out that the USA dropped a nuke on Japan or that there is zika in Brazil are racist?  Pretty sure those are just facts which ended up being using in bad jokes.

Big difference between rude and racist.
You will be back. You guys are too good not to.  Let's see if they can bring the same game they showed today!
It's unfair that SK didn't have to play any Bo3s today :>
Funny thing is TL's win was comparable to C9's major win in that it was a team effort with really solid fragging from everyone concerned.
SK lost three of their last four Bo3 series vs. NA teams and their win was vs. Torqued.
SK? More like SKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
The top 2 NA CS:GO line-ups have never had this much skill stacked in them and relative to the top EU sides.
Helps that this match is not at a tournament with a big stage set-up or huge prestige.  Removes some of SK's advantages.  No real reason for TL players to feel pressure.
Before we get the "it's the first tournament" complaint, remember that SK claimed to have been praccing with boltz over felps the entire time and not changing many positions.

Can't have it both ways, bruh.

The banter in the C9-TL thread is pretty good.  Tons of good jokes and references.
C9 losing summit obv is no drastic strike against their major win, but hopefully it suggests to some of their more ardent supporters that their major victory was not the result of some genius read of the meta and completely strategically outplaying the top teams.
Let's film a new channel ident where you say the same thing "this is tarik and I play for [my team] and we will be the best team in [this year]" but this time it can actually be serious and not for comedy purposes!

Cloud9 are 3:3 on overpass offline in the last three months and two of those losses are to FaZe.

It's a waste of a question to ask a young pro if they'll feel pressure on a stage they've never played on.  Being so young, they always claim they won't and that they don't get affected by pressure.

Just look at Twistzz at ESL NY and Stewie here.
FaZe used to be a team who monstered CT side and then had to get pistol and force-buys on T side to close out.  Now they are rolling over T sides.  This FaZe is way scarier.
I analyse the game based on past match-ups and current strengths.  I don't claim to be able to predict the future.

Am I missing something or did Blizzard basically suggest to the press that their OWL rev has exceeded expectations, w/o any kind of independent verification, and that "oh BTW we'll be expanding and putting the buy-in price up".

Nobody sees any issues with this?
steel and kioShiMa are great examples of why players from the Brazilian and French scenes should work on their English.  

Sure, ideally you want to be in a team which naturally fits you, but give yourself options because you never know where your career will go.
Blizzard has already encouraged what seemed to be somewhat irresponsible high stakes gambling for Over-- oh wait you meant actual betting :>

The "Open Era" of tennis began in 1968 and Roger Federer has won 10% (20) of the 200 Grand Slams  held over that span of time.
We had a lot of famous force-buy teams in the play-offs.
Going back over the VODs, I think our three man ESL One New York desk was actually an under-rated group and we had a lot of time to discuss the games and complement each other's skill-sets.

Shoutout to @PaulChaloner and @SPUNJ for that.
It's so tilt-worthy when instead of individual game VODs there's a 6-9h VOD, so you can't easily navigate the time-line.
I notice you didn't answer.  You could even have said "I was young but I went back and rewatched the games a year or two ago".  Sounds like you aren't interested in discussion yourself.
What I love about kuroky's popularity hitting its zenith in this era is how unfair RTZ fanboys were back when Secret broke up that first time and implied Kuroky was in some way the bad team-mate.

Great read on one of the best team-mates of all time, shitters :>
How old were you in 2003?
Fair enough.  As someone who is a mod your reply sounded like you thought those were damning details which made her ban justified.  Thanks for the clarification.
Did you bother reading further in the thread?
One thing I think is cool about CS:GO is that the analysts/experts I know check twitter pretty frequently so it means those not at the event citing stats/trivia can find its way onto the desk.

None of us is as smart as all of us, as the Japanese say.
Might sound like cheating but if it doesn't happen then you ignored that either you didn't want it as much as you claimed or it wasn't right for you.

#FanLogicpic.twitter.com/ZAwu9NP1xb
coldzera aside, you have to figure FaZe must be tilted by that C9 2:0 of SK.  C9 are basically a poor man's FaZe and yet not only did they beat FaZe out of nowhere but then did what FaZe has never done to SK, beating them in a Bo3 and cleanly.
As usual, those fans have disappeared under a rock for a few months never to be heard from again.  The shit-talking dries up real fast nowadays.
Actually I guess SK can just choose not to pick nuke as the last, so both will probably mirror nuke skip.
Let's hope SK beat TL so we can get that potential four map classic between SK and C9 later.

C9 can basically skip the nuke ban and force SK to waste their ban on it too, since there's no second ban rotation.  Nice edge to be found for C9 there.
Xizt has averaged more deaths than kills at his last eight straight LANs.
See if you can spot the outlier.  Nvm, tons of you told @lurppis he was wrong and that REZ had changed and been fixed by a sports psychologist and could maintain his IEM form.

If you're gonna call someone the best then judge them according to that standard else you're really just a fan.
Every tournament that is both a long league (5+) weeks and has a play-offs should have trophies and prize money for both phases. Totally different tournament formats and thus requiring different strengths.

C9 have had startlingly even group effort across their top four players, but unless someone goes ham I think even if they win the title that a FaZe player is the MVP.
FaZe legitimately has three players contending for the MVP (NiKo, olof and GuardiaN) and one (rain) who could go nuts in the final and win it too.

We've never seen a team like this before in Counter-Strike.
Those are all legit big LANs too, no cs_summit or Dreamhack Summer in there.
This thread will blow your mind and make you despair for the future of esports.

https://twitter.com/BrittanyVenti/status/957379376080916481 …
FaZe have made the final of six of their first nine events with this line-up.  Three titles in the bag already and the potential of adding a major if they can win one more Bo3.
I'm onboard with the first ever esports Black Mirror episodehttps://twitter.com/ESLDota2/status/957541556910637057 …
"I don't control or make money off this thing?  It's morally corrupt and unacceptable then"
It's fitting that autimatic had a huge performance in the SK victory being as that was the case back when the old C9 roster beat SK in the EPL S4 final.
"SK has never won a major without fnx"

He's also failed to even play in the last three.

Respect to @s1mpleO for reaching his third major semi-final. He's made it that far with 9 different team-mates. One of the best CS:GO players we have ever seen.

One day the trophy!
Time to win your first
I used to be in favour of having players in a studio without an audience, since 99.999999% of viewers are online anyway, but the down-side of that is there is less pressure on the players, which I think it a bad thing for the world championship.
Eight of the 10 players in tomorrow's major final have never played in one before:

NiKo
karrigan
rain
Stewie2k
autimatic
tarik
RUSH
Skadoodle
karrigan makes his first ever major final, after having a team capable of winning one numerous times.  Let's see if he makes the most of it.
They complained about it before they played the Ro8.  Stay in your lane if you don't know what you're talking about.https://twitter.com/JasonNick/status/957449623416680450 …
Those unaware of the context of SK complaining about playing two Bo3s in one day, this happened to them at the last ELEAGUE major too, when they played FaZe in Ro8 and VP in semis.

It's a perfectly valid complaint.
So glad to see KRiMZ consistently performing like this. One of the best players to spectate for fundamental Counter-Strike.

I hope this won't be the last time @felperaa plays in the semi-final of a major.  He didn't get all his spots in SK but he can be one of the best players in CS:GO playing in his own team!

If you think C9 is gonna win vs. FaZe then don't sit back like a pussy and claim as much after the final.  Let's hear you now.
You mean from playing them in prac?
Pretty sure having the opponent pick mirage vs. you is FaZe's wet dream, mate :>
Do you think they know you play it?
MLG had a sick idea a few years ago to do one side of the bracket on a separate day, so two quarters + the semi day 1 and then the other 2 quarters + the other semi day 2.  Pretty cool idea, but Valve shot it down.
The big problem with four Bo3s in one day, so in other words the entire quarter-finals, is that it puts a lot of strain on staff who work all day without breaks and can give you problems with the venue and fans travelling home, if you get any delays.
I've never seen you play nuke on LAN with this line-up, so I don't know that you play it.  If you do then I'm surprised you don't abuse the veto more yourselves.
I agree, but I can't see what the right solution is.  Maybe we should move to two quarter-finals per day and have them on either side of the bracket, so the two teams who go through first day can prac each other in the day off before the semis?
Yeah, I mean as in SK float nuke and then ban inferno.  If you dare pick it under those circumstances then cool but I'd have to see it to believe it.
What solution would you suggest?
In some senses this is actually a better pure accomplishment for NA than either of the TL major runs and OpTic winning EL S2, as those teams had foreign star players.
SK made a big mistake in this tournament refusing to float nuke vs. teams who never play or pick it themselves.  Almost cost them the series vs. FNATIC and did vs. C9.
I hope it's good but I suspect the final is gonna be pretty one-sided.
I had C9 as my underdog pick for the major when Richard asked me on BtN, being as we specified it had to be a true underdog (so not FaZe, SK or G2), but I didn't think it would be in this kind of fashion.
C9 are a huge underdog in the final.  We've seen them lose Bo3 series to FaZe a three straight times already and by large margins.
Still insane SK have finished top 4 even at the majors they used stand-ins for.
Great play throughout the play-offs so far from C9.  Some very legit wins.  Up there with the best accomplishments in the history of NA CS:GO already.
Revenge has nothing to do with justice and that's precisely why social justice is corrosive to society.

It's always fascinating how people's statements betray their psychological underpinnings.  Talk to someone with an authoritarian streak and every opinion you express will be treated as something you think should be forcibly mandated upon everyone.
Pros seemingly imagine CS is a subject learned in a linear fashion and that if they know more in one sense they know more in all.

I might not understand anything TACO has learned, but him imagining he understands what I have learned is naive or arrogant.

Na`Vi did the Cloud9 super soldier buy (getting AK + armour on someone after a lost pistol with bomb plant).  If there was ever a team to do it then Na`Vi is it.  Give s1mple the gun advantage and let him work.

It's my theory Twitter is popular precisely because it generates emotional reactions due to character limit hindering understanding.

If you're gonna play this game then you have to know that and be able to take the hits so you benefit from the free publicity.
If you want proof Twitter is more about wilfully misinterpreting people's opinions to get outraged rather than trying to understand what they're communicating just look at this J.J. Reddick storm in a teacup.
Me when C9 won the major and people were trying to claim they had solved the CT meta of inferno and were tactically outplaying FaZe.https://twitter.com/MetalGearEbooks/status/964653431578398721 …
Bravo to @cssltv for an amazing schedule which gives us the chance to fully focus on a couple of series each but enough of a break to not ruin is physically and mentally.
No matter the fairy tell movie ending people want for their careers I'd rather they go a year too late, and know it, than a year too early and regret it.

The opposite applies for teams, though.
Not a fan of people telling pasha he should retire and be a streamer.  Odds are you only get one chance at being a world class pro player and there has never been a better time in history than now, so ride it until the end and then go once you have nothing left.
What a ridiculous round win with nothing from SK.  Sick stuff from coldzera.
Would be pretty fitting for the last ever game of felps-SK to be losing the game on CT side of inferno.
SK look shook.  Usually have such poise and make the right counter-plays.  Big balls C9 are rolling them.
First NBK couldn't hear his team and now SK players can't hear their own crowd comming for them.  When will everything be fair? :>
Was sleeping, mate.  Don't have to watch all the games live when I'm at home :>  Could tell FaZe vs. Na`Vi was gonna be one to watch as a VOD, not a classic.
Surprised YNk was the only talent at the event to pick SK to beat C9.  I think it's usually a mistake to put too much stock in short-term form at the event itself.
"Why are you so mean to C9 fans?"

I guess you could call it "regression to the mean", a concept they seem unfamiliar with :>
If you want a laugh ask one of those guys who has created a rating formula how they came about it.  It's like listening to a religion being made, as they declare certain concepts more important with no clear reasoning and then work off those flawed assumptions.

If you win a major and fail to perform to that level before and after then you are by definition a fluke champion.

"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." 
-Will Durant
It's quite telling how many fans legitimately think every famous team who isn't winning has one problem, who is a player, and if they keep losing after he is gone then he wasn't "the problem".

VP had plenty of problems and TaZ was one of them.

I knew there were some plebs in the C9 fanbase but trying to claim only majors matter when your team did nothing at them for 3+ years is a new low.

It's kinda wack when people make out like losing a key rounds justifies "being on tilt" and losing sometimes double digit gun rounds.  Grow the fuck up, guys.  Champions tilt for a few rounds but not a half and then another map etc.

It's not that the last match shows the flaw of reseeding overtly.  Obviously HellRaisers could only play one team, but it doesn't mean the other match-ups all had to go that way and ofc HR should never have drawn such lesser teams earlier anyway.

Just like that Na`Vi have a chance to potentially win the worst map of the three.  Let's see some classic SK T side comeback to give us a thrilling series.

As easy as it is to criticise Na`Vi, they have been gradually improving ever since electronic arrived.  Whether that's electronic's impact, flamie's return or Zeus doing work is far from ascertained.

Reminder that all countries are equally good. Damn those laws we have in the West requiring people not to drill in residential areas at night!
My working theory, in as much as it reminds me of it, is jealous friend syndrome.  They see that you respect and admire the individual in question and they are jealous that you've granted them status and thus want to bring them low to show you that they are better.
I see a trend that there's a kind of person out there who if they find out you enjoy listening to some public speaker they look for the most extreme thing they can find about them and then attempt to discredit everything that person has said as meaningless.
They are either undertaking the interview in bad faith or they have explicitly been given an agenda to press and are faithfully executing that directive.
To write such people off as "dumb" is to take the matter far too lightly.  To interview someone is to be curious about what they think, yet these people come in with a rigid set of preconceptions they will not give up no matter evidence presented to the contrary.
Oh look, there's an Asian male Cathy Newman!

Interviewers interupting the interviewee right after asking them a question and then rephrasing their statements as straw-man arguments is a product of both incompetence and malice.
